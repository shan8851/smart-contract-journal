# Smart Contract Learning Journal

This repo tracks my journey to become a stronger smart contract developer. It will focus on the non coding aspects mainly. I already hack away at various contracts here and there, but it is clear I need a deeper understanding to build more complex contracts, so this repo will serve as my home for all the knowledge I gain.

## Structure

- `daily-logs/`: Quick summaries of daily readings and reflections
- `weekly-summaries/`: Weekly learnings, retros, and next steps
- `contract-teardowns/`: Deep dives into protocols like Uniswap, Compound, Aragon
- `deep-dives/`: EVM, Solidity internals, or governance mechanics
- `blog-drafts/`: Polished or WIP writing for potential publishing on my [website](https://shan8851.com)

## Goals

- Build long-term context around Solidity, the EVM, and real world protocol architecture
- Maintain a versioned history of my learning process
- Shareable, readable format to turn into blog posts or discussions
